# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

In this section you will find a list of resources to learn fundamental concepts about AI, starting with Mathematics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general.

## Programming Languages and Frameworks

Python is the most popular programming language used in AI development.
You should have at least a basic understanding of Python to make the most of
your AI learning journey.

## AI Frameworks

In addition to Python, a number of libraries and frameworks have been developed to
help train a model and run inference after the model has been trained.
We will primarily use PyTorch due to its popularity and support for AMD technologies.

- [Introduction to PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/introyt1_tutorial.html)

- [scikit-learn tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/)

Other popular AI frameworks are:

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) an end-to-end platform for machine learning.

- [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Python library for accelerator-oriented array computation and program transformation, designed for high-performance numerical computing and large-scale machine learning.

- [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) is an open format built to represent machine learning models.

- [Triton](https://triton-lang.org/main/) is a language and compiler for parallel programming. It aims to provide a Python-based programming environment for productively writing custom DNN compute kernels capable of running at maximal throughput on modern GPU hardware.

- [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) is a deep learning optimization library that makes distributed training and inference easy, efficient, and effective.

- [OpenXLA](https://openxla.org/) an open ecosystem of performant, portable, and extensible machine learning (ML) infrastructure components that simplify ML development by defragmenting the tools between frontend frameworks and hardware backends. Built by industry leaders in AI modeling, software, and hardware.

## Math and AI

A good math foundation would help you understand AI/ML underlying concepts,
such as convolutions, linear layers, backpropagation, gradient descent and others.
Although, we will not cover these topic in details in any of the notebooks,
we list a number of resources that you can use as reference.
Navigate to the following sections to find more resources.
