# AUP AI Tutorials

## Welcome to the AMD University Program AI Educational Guide

This guide takes you through every stage of the AI workflow—from training to deployment—on AMD technology.
The first release of this material focuses on AMD CPUs, APUs and GPUs, including: {bdg-primary}`AMD EPYC™ Processors` {bdg-primary}`AMD Ryzen™ Processors` {bdg-primary}`AMD Ryzen™ AI Processors`, and AMD GPUs: {bdg-primary}`AMD Instinct™ Accelerators` {bdg-primary}`AMD Radeon™ RX Graphics Cards` {bdg-primary}`AMD Radeon™ PRO Graphics Cards`.

For a full list of supported hardware see [supported hardware](#supported-hw).

## What You will Learn

This guide is divided into three sections, covering everything from AI/ML fundamentals to advanced optimization techniques for maximizing performance on AMD hardware.

You will explore:

* Running a range of machine learning models, from CNNs like LeNet, ResNet and Yolo for computer vision tasks, to LLMs such as LLaMA, FLAN, and Whisper for natural language processing and chatbots.
* Using pre-trained models from Hugging Face and fine-tuning them for your specific needs.
* Designing, training, and optimizing your own custom models for deployment.

Each example includes a Jupyter Notebook that can be run in a Docker container for easy experimentation.

## Guide Structure

Get started by choosing your learning path:

* [Running Inference](paths.md#inference-path): Learn how to deploy and run pre-trained models on AMD technology.
* [Model Training](paths.md#training-path): Train your own AI models from scratch using AMD hardware.
* [Model Optimization](paths.md#optimization-path): Fine-tune and optimize models for maximum performance on AMD platforms.

Additionally, this guide provides external resources to help you expand your AI knowledge on AMD hardware.
