# Glossary

## AI

Artificial Intelligence

## APU

Application Processing Unit - a compute chip that combines a x86 CPU, GPU and NPU integrated in the same chip.

## CNN

Convolutional Neural Network

## CPU

Central Processing Unit - Generic compute unit that supports a broad number of workloads.

## Dataset

A collection of data points organized in categories. E.g., pictures of cats and dogs.
The data points can be labelled or not.

## DNN

Deep Neural Network

## Inference

Applying a machine learning model to an input and generating a predicted output

## GPU

Graphics Processing Unit - Special compute unit optimized for graphics and also for machine learning computation.

## ML

Machine Learning.

## LLM

Large Language Model.

## LSTM

Long short-term memory.

## NPU

Neural Processing Unit - Special compute unit optimized for machine learning computation.

## numpy

NumPy is a powerful numerical computing library for Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is widely used in scientific and data-related tasks for its efficiency and ease of use, allowing for fast and convenient manipulation of numerical data in Python programs.

## PyTorch

PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.

## RNN

Recurrent Neural Network.

## SLM

Small Language Model.

## Training

Training is a process in which a model learns patterns, features and outputs by being exposed to a dataset.

## scikit-learn

Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy.
